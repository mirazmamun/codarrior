Hi there, this is Miraz Al-Mamun. I voyager from Melbourne, Australia. I love to be in Melbourne as much as I do exploring innovations in web technologies. I am Web and DevOps Engineer by profession who had made foary into Machine Learning as AI Platform Engineer. So there are so many areas I try to learn, practise and forget and get challenged. Trying to be a jack-of-all-trade is really daunting and I try not do that as I am pretty clumsy at multitasking. But so many astounding discovery and reasearch taunts me eveyday that I hardly can turn my back. So here I am, always intrigued by stuffs to learn. I learn, practise and make mistakes everyday. 

From affairs at home, I am a father of a son and beloved husband. Also coming all the way from Bangladesh and living here in Australia since 2008. I am graduate in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (E.E.E.), M.Sc. in IT. I am avid fan of Comedy, Thriller genre but not quite into SciFi. I wish someday I would write my hearts out and that would turn into a soulful novel.
