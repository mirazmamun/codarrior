title: It hurts to lose someone that close
---
Date was 26 July, 2020.
Melbourne is in strict lockdown. The news broke early in my morning time, bolt from the blue. It was my beloved father. I did not realise at first
the gravity of the situation. To be honest it did not strike me around that time. Reality took over to take care of all rituals. I would rather say, all my the kiths
& kins, they took care of it, as I could not travel back home, Bangladesh, due to the situation.

Then the agony started surfacing, it becomes unbearable, when I ponder about it. Reason it becomes so hurtful is there is no one to appeal to, for reverting or annuling
it. It is such a gaping hole, not to be filled.

My father was just an ordinary father, no fancy, just uncool, down-to-earth dad. A moderately old person without any ostentation, lower-middle classed guy. But the 
very best thing he adhered to is his honesty, principle, integrity and love of simplicity.

Every time I reminisce of him, a crushing wave sweeps over me, of this aching helplessness. May ALLAH bless him, keep him safe.
