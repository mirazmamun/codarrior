title: Why is there so much to learn
---

It always boggles me, the relentless pursuit of learning. I have a very frustrating habit of jumping topics as soon as I start to read something. Yesterday
I got my eyes caught at open source OS for embedded devices. TBH I started off the journey aiming at some available Open Source SaaS boilerplate for some hobby
project I am after then ended up in [OSRTOS](https://www.osrtos.com/). This is fascinating how I got drifted there. But this always let me discover some topic
I was not aware before.

Again, today, when I kicked off another journey I found myself on this repo, https://github.com/neonbjb/tortoise-tts. Being in AI Engineering I always get 
carried away by topics of NLP. I guess, next destination would be demystify Diffusion based models. Let me see!
