It is 2018 and holiday season has just kicked off. Some solid time with family and friends. After long it is summer in Melbourne. Really enjoying the sun this year after long wait for it. Also, mango season is here, yum. After couple of year of scarcity yummy juicy mangoes are affordable now. Have some glut.

Stay cool and safe everyone.
